## Description
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for performing statistical analysis on data obtained from the SECCM data treatment process. The analysis focuses on exploring the relationship between droplet contact area and pitting behavior, comparing electrochemical parameters, and applying regression models to better understand localized corrosion behavior.

## Workflow Overview
1) Data Collection:

Pitting Behavior: Stable and metastable pits in PDP curves were identified and counted using the SECCM data treatment code. These counts were recorded in Excel sheets.
Droplet Contact Area: Measured using ImageJ software and saved in the same Excel sheet.


2) Statistical Analysis:

The data was analyzed to explore trends and relationships, including:
- Area Histogram Spread: Distribution of droplet areas.

- Area vs. Pitting Behavior: Relationship between droplet area and the number of stable and metastable pits.

- OCP and Ecorr Comparisons: Between PDPs showing pitting and those without pitting.
  

3) Regression Models:

Linear, logistic, and Poisson regressions were performed to quantify relationships between variables and predict trends.
